Hello there,
It's my first official repo on Github.
I made interactive character sheet for a tabletop role-playing game using the BRP system. The script utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and incorporates various features such as data entry for character details, characteristics, hit points, skills, and equipment. The user can navigate through different sections of the character creation process, and the script validates and saves the entered data. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for players to easily create and manage characters for BRP-based RPG sessions.
